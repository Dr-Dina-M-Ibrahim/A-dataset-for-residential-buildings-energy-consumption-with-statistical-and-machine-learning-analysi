A dataset for residential buildings energy consumption with statistical and machine learning analysis

We present a new dataset for energy consumption of residential buildings and examines the impact of residential buildingsâ€™ eight input variables (Building Size, Floor Height, Glazing Area, Wall Area, window to wall ratio (WWR), Win Glazing U-value, Roof U-value, and External Wall U-value) on the heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) output variables. 
We explain how we execute the methods and statistical analysis results using SPSS statistical software:
1. Data Exploration
2. Statistical Analysis using SPSS statistical software

We illustrate how we perform the machine Learning-Based Analysis using SPSS statistical software:
1. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) Analysis
2. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Analysis

The simulated buildings were generated using the IES<VE> simulation software (Available: https://www.iesve.com/ )
